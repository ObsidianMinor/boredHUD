Personal todo list:
- edit replay menu
- edit loading screen

I keep updated on StaticVoid's version of the HUD so these below are his todo items.

- Quest log opening
- mannpower supernova powerup meter

- scoreboard top bars need to be a more tf2 themed color
- taunt menu doesn't have the same bg as the build and demolish menus
