            boredHUD Installation
----------------------------------------------
1.) Navigate to the Zip you downloaded boredHUD within
2.) Extract files into a folder named boredHUD on your desktop
3.) Move the boredHUD folder you just created to your TF2 custom folder.  This can be found by either going to:

C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\
or if you're on a 64-bit OS:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\

If you are on Linux, this may be found in:
~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/

NOTE: On Linux, the boredHUD directory MUST be in lowercase (so, "boredhud").

If you have installed Steam into another directory, please navigate to it and follow the above folder navigation.
4.) Run TF2 and the HUD should be installed

			4x3 and 16x10 Installation
----------------------------------------------
The current HUD is optimized to run at 16x9 resolutions, most specifically 1280x720 and 1920x1080.  Other resolutions will cause errors within the files, to edit this for your resolution, go to the boredHUD folder and follow these instructions:

1.) Open your respected aspect ratio folder (4x3 or 16x10)
2.) Copy and paste the resource and the scripts file into the boredHUD folder
3.) Confirm the overwrite message that pops up
4.) Run TF2, and the HUD should be working!
